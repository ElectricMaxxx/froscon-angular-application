# EbookPrototype

This project is an example appplicaiton for two use cases:

1. Experiements to create epub books for myself
2. Bad Code example to refactor and to learn angular applications

So what we gonna do here is (afeter having a short intor into general structure und elements of an angular application):

- build services to separate logic code and display code 
- build lots components to separate and reuse templating code
- decorate the third party usages

Doing so we will learn lots of core features of angular:

- components and templating
- databing for sure
- form handling, maybe we can also have a look into reactive forms too
- dependency injection
